## Summary

This software contains a proof of concept for a MW3 vulnerability that was first discovered in late 2019.
The exploit has since been mitigated, but the underlying bug in the client remains.

## How does this work?

The exploit works by modifying the server name with a malicious string of characters.

## Compile from source

- Clone the Git repo. Do NOT download it as ZIP, that won't work.
- Run `premake5 vs2019` or simply use the delivered `generate.bat`.
- Build via solution file in `build\server-list-exploit.sln`.
